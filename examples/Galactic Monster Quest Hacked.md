## Use Cheat Engine
 
Cheat Engine is a powerful tool that allows you to modify the values of any game running on your computer. You can use it to change the amount of credits you have in Galactic Monster Quest and bypass the paywall. Here's how:
 
1. Download and install Cheat Engine from [here](https://www.cheatengine.org/).
2. Open Galactic Monster Quest in your browser and log in to your account.
3. Open Cheat Engine and click on the computer icon on the top left corner.
4. Select your browser process from the list and click on Open.
5. In the Value Type dropdown menu, select Double.
6. In the Value box, enter your current amount of credits and click on First Scan.
7. You should see some results on the left panel. Go back to the game and spend or earn some credits.
8. In the Value box, enter your new amount of credits and click on Next Scan.
9. You should see one or a few results on the left panel. Select them all and click on the red arrow below.
10. The results will move to the bottom panel. Double-click on each value and change it to whatever amount you want.
11. Go back to the game and refresh the page. You should see your credits updated to the new amount.

Note: This method may not work if the credits are stored on the server side. In that case, you will only see a temporary change in your credits that will revert back once you refresh the page or log out.
 
## Reverse Engineer the Game Code
 
If you have some programming skills, you can try to reverse engineer the game code and find out how it works. You can use tools like [Beautifier](https://beautifier.io/) or [JSNice](https://www.jsnice.org/) to make the code more readable and understandable. You can also use [Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/developer-tools/ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi) or [Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug/) to inspect the elements and network requests of the game. You might be able to find some vulnerabilities or loopholes that you can exploit to hack Galactic Monster Quest and get unlimited credits.
 
For example, one user on Reddit suggested that you could try to reverse engineer their data-navigate format to craft your own values[^3^]. This is an example of one of the data-navigate values: #/dialogue/choice/choice/a90d4e456046c96ba37fe638356f0b94a8f0898d/ \uD83E\uDD37ââï¸. You might be able to manipulate this value to access different dialogues or sequences that are normally locked behind a paywall.
 
Note: This method requires a lot of time, patience, and skill. It may also violate the terms of service of Galactic Monster Quest and get you banned from playing.
 
## Play a Cracked Version of the Game
 
If you don't want to bother with hacking or reverse engineering, you can simply play a cracked version of Galactic Monster Quest that gives you unlimited credits. There are some websites that offer such versions of HTML5 games for free. However, you should be careful when visiting these websites as they may contain malware, viruses, or other harmful content.
