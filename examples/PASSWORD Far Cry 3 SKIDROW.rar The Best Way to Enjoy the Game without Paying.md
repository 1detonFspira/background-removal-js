If you want to play Far Cry 3 on your PC, you can download the SKIDROW version from various torrent sites. However, you will need a password to extract the files from the RAR archive. In this article, we will show you how to get the password and install the game.
 
## Step 1: Download the RAR file
 
The first step is to download the RAR file that contains the game files. You can find it on many torrent sites, such as The Pirate Bay, Kickass Torrents, or 1337x. The file name is PASSWORD Far Cry 3 SKIDROW.rar and it has a size of about 9.6 GB.
 
Make sure you have a torrent client installed on your PC, such as uTorrent, BitTorrent, or qBittorrent. Then, open the torrent file or copy the magnet link and paste it into your torrent client. Wait for the download to finish.
 
## Step 2: Get the password
 
The next step is to get the password that will allow you to extract the files from the RAR archive. The password is not provided by the uploader, but you can get it from a website that is linked in the torrent description.
 
Open the torrent description and look for a link that says something like "Get password here" or "Download password here". The link will take you to a website that will ask you to complete a survey or an offer before giving you the password.
 
It is likely a fake file that contains malware or viruses that can harm your PC or steal your personal information[^2^] [^3^].,  It requires a password that is not provided by the uploader and is hidden behind surveys or ads that are also malicious[^2^] [^3^].,  It does not guarantee that the game will work properly or at all, as it may be corrupted, incomplete or incompatible with your system[^2^] [^3^].,  It deprives the developers and publishers of Far Cry 3 of their rightful income and recognition for their hard work and creativity[^1^].,  It violates the intellectual property rights and terms of service of Far Cry 3 and its owners[^1^].
 
Be careful when completing these surveys or offers, as they may contain malware or phishing attempts. Do not enter any personal or financial information on these websites. Use a fake email address and a disposable phone number if possible.
 
Once you complete the survey or offer, you should get a text file that contains the password. The password is usually a random string of letters and numbers, such as "a4b5c6d7e8f9" or "skidrow1234". Copy the password and save it somewhere.
 
## Step 3: Extract and install the game
 
The final step is to extract and install the game on your PC. To do this, you will need a software that can handle RAR files, such as WinRAR, 7-Zip, or PeaZip.
 
Right-click on the RAR file and select "Extract here" or "Extract to PASSWORD Far Cry 3 SKIDROW". You will be prompted to enter the password that you got from the previous step. Paste the password and click OK.
 
The extraction process may take some time depending on your PC's performance. Once it is done, you should see a folder named PASSWORD Far Cry 3 SKIDROW that contains several files and folders.
 
Open the folder and look for a file named setup.exe or install.exe. Double-click on it and follow the instructions to install the game on your PC. You may need to choose a destination folder and agree to some terms and conditions.
 
After the installation is complete, you can launch the game from your desktop or start menu. Enjoy playing Far Cry 3!
