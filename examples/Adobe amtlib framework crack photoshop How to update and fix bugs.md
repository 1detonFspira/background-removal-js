Abadilla, Ildefonso Santos, Juan C. Laya, Teodoro A. Agoncillo, and Rufino Alejandro. These writers applied various theories and methods to critique Philippine literature and culture. Meanwhile, other writers such as Liwayway Arceo, Brigido Batungbakal, Genoveva Edroza-Matute, Macario Pineda, Amado V. Hernandez, Salvador R. Barros, and Pablo R. Glorioso produced essays that explored personal experiences, social issues, historical events, and artistic expressions.
  
The critical essay in the Philippines was influenced by various literary movements and schools of thought that emerged in Europe and America during the 19th and 20th centuries. Among these were romanticism, realism, naturalism, modernism, existentialism, structuralism, poststructuralism, and postcolonialism. The Filipino writers adapted these ideas to suit the local context and to address the specific needs and challenges of the Philippine society.
