To obtain a Tia 942 certification, you need to contact a licensed certification body (CB) that can provide auditing and certification services. The CB will conduct an on-site audit of your data center and verify its conformity with the standard. The audit will cover all aspects of the data center infrastructure, including site location, architectural, electrical, mechanical, fire safety, telecommunication, security, and other requirements. The CB will also issue a certificate and a report that document the findings and recommendations of the audit.
  
Tia 942 certification is valid for three years from the date of issue. During this period, you need to maintain your data center in accordance with the standard and undergo periodic surveillance audits by the CB. You also need to inform the CB of any changes or modifications that may affect your data center's conformity with the standard. At the end of the three-year period, you need to apply for a recertification audit to renew your certificate.
