Hpqflash 3 is a utility that allows you to flash the system BIOS on HP notebooks operating in a Microsoft Windows environment. It is included in the BIOS update files that you can download from the official HP support website. In this article, we will show you how to download and use Hpqflash 3 to update your HP notebook BIOS safely and easily.
 
## Step 1: Find and Download the BIOS Update File
 
The first step is to find and download the BIOS update file that matches your HP notebook model and operating system. You can do this by visiting the [HP Customer Support - Software and Driver Downloads](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers) page and entering your product name or number in the search box. Alternatively, you can use the [HP Support Assistant](https://support.hp.com/us-en/help/detect-hp-products) or [HP Smart](https://www8.hp.com/us/en/campaigns/hpsupportassistant/hpsupport.html) apps to automatically detect your product and find the latest drivers and software for it.

Once you have found your product, select your operating system from the drop-down menu and click on the BIOS category to expand it. You will see a list of available BIOS updates for your notebook. Look for the one that has "HPQFlash" in the description and click on the Download button next to it. Save the file to a folder on your hard drive and make a note of its location.
 
## Step 2: Run the BIOS Update File
 
The next step is to run the BIOS update file that you have downloaded. Double-click on the file and follow the on-screen instructions. The file will extract the Hpqflash 3 utility and a binary image of the system BIOS (ROM) to a temporary folder on your hard drive. You will also see an information page that explains how to use Hpqflash 3 and other methods to update the BIOS.
 
One of the methods is to use F10 setup BIOS flashing, which is recommended by HP. This method allows you to flash the BIOS from within the F10 setup menu without booting into Windows. To use this method, follow these steps:
 
1. Reboot your notebook and press F10 to enter setup.
2. In the File menu, select the "Flash System ROM" item.
3. This flash utility will prompt you to select the media containing the BIOS image file (XXX\_MMmm.bin). The binary image file is contained in the DOS Flash directory of the temporary folder where you extracted the BIOS update file. You can use any removable media such as USB or legacy floppy diskette to copy this file to.
4. Select the media that contains the BIOS image file and press Enter.
5. The utility will verify the file and flash the BIOS. You will be prompted when the process is completed.
6. The new BIOS code will not take effect until you reboot your notebook.

Another method is to use Hpqflash 3 from within Windows. To use this method, follow these steps:

1. Run Hpqflash 3 from the temporary folder where you extracted the BIOS update file. You can do this by double-clicking on Hpqflash.exe or by clicking on Start > Run and typing "C:\SWSetup\SPxxxxx\Hpqflash.exe" where SPxxxxx is the name of the folder.
2. A dialog box will appear asking you if you want to update your system BIOS. Click Yes.
3. The utility will verify your current BIOS version and compare it with the new one. If they are different, it will prompt you to back up your current BIOS settings before proceeding. Click Yes if you want to back up your settings or No if you don't.
4. The utility will flash the BIOS and prompt you to restart your notebook. Click Yes to restart or No if you want to restart later.
5. The new BIOS code will take effect after you restart your notebook.
