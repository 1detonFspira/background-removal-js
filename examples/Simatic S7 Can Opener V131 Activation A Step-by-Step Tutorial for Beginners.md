# How to Use Simatic S7 Can Opener V131 to Unlock Protected Blocks in Siemens S7 PLCs
 
If you are working with Siemens S7 PLCs, you may encounter some blocks that are protected with the "know\_how\_protect" keyword. This means that you cannot view or edit the source code of these blocks, and you can only use them as compiled blocks. This can be a problem if you need to modify or troubleshoot the blocks, or if you want to learn from them.

Fortunately, there is a tool that can help you unlock these protected blocks: Simatic S7 Can Opener V131. This tool can remove the "know\_how\_protect" keyword from any block in your S7 project or library, allowing you to access the source code and edit it as you wish. You can also use this tool to protect your own blocks with the "know\_how\_protect" keyword, if you want to prevent others from viewing or modifying them.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Simatic S7 Can Opener V131 to unlock protected blocks in Siemens S7 PLCs. We will also explain some of the features and limitations of this tool, and provide some tips and precautions for using it.
 
## What is Simatic S7 Can Opener V131?
 
Simatic S7 Can Opener V131 is a software tool that can modify the "know\_how\_protect" status of any block in a Siemens S7 project or library. It can remove or add this keyword to any block, regardless of its type (FB, FC, OB, DB) or origin (system or user-defined). It can also display the list of all blocks in a project or library, along with their protection status.
 
Simatic S7 Can Opener V131 is useful when:
 
- Your machinery supplier or system integrator does no longer support the software they developed and you are in trouble with S7 PLC programs where some blocks are protected.
- You lost your source code and you cannot access your compiled blocks anymore.
- You want to keep just one copy of your blocks instead of maintaining both compiled and source copies of each block.
- You want to toggle the "know\_how\_protect" keyword on-the-fly, without having to compile your blocks.

Simatic S7 Can Opener V131 does not remove the protection from SFB and SFC blocks. These blocks are just calls to functions stored within the PLC system memory; no executable code is available within these blocks. You can only unlock these blocks by using a special hardware device called a "PLC Blaster".
