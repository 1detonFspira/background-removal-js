In January 2013, Adobe faced a technical glitch in its activation servers that affected some of its Creative Suite products, including Photoshop CS2 (9.0). These products required online activation to verify the validity of the user license. However, due to the server malfunction, many users were unable to activate their products or faced activation errors. To resolve this issue, Adobe decided to release a special version of Photoshop CS2 and some other CS2 products that did not require activation. Adobe also provided an official serial number for this version on its website. Users who had previously purchased Photoshop CS2 or had a valid license could download and use this version for free. However, this was not intended as a giveaway or a free upgrade for anyone. Adobe also clarified that Photoshop CS2 was an outdated product that might not run properly on newer operating systems. Photoshop CS2 is an application written in Java. It requires a Java virtual machine to run on a computer.
  
A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a software program that executes Java code and enables Java applications to run on different platforms. A JVM acts as an interpreter between the Java code and the underlying operating system and hardware. It also provides memory management, garbage collection, security, and other features for Java applications. A JVM is an essential component of the Java platform, which consists of the Java programming language, the Java class libraries, and the Java runtime environment.

Photoshop CS2 requires a JVM to run because it uses some Java components for its functionality. For example, some of the filters and effects in Photoshop CS2 are written in Java. To use Photoshop CS2, you need to have a compatible JVM installed on your computer. The recommended JVM for Photoshop CS2 is Sun Java 1.4.2 or later. You can download it from the Oracle website or use the link provided by Adobe when you download Photoshop CS2. You also need to make sure that the JVM is enabled in the Photoshop preferences.
  
If you have a newer version of Photoshop, such as Photoshop CC or Photoshop 2021, you do not need a JVM to run it. These versions of Photoshop do not use Java components and are compatible with modern operating systems and hardware. They also offer more features, performance, and security than Photoshop CS2. You can purchase a subscription to Photoshop or the Creative Cloud suite from the Adobe website or use a free trial version for a limited time.
