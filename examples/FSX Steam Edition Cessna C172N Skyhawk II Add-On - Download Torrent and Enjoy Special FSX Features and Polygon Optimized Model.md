The Cessna 172 Skyhawk has a long and rich history that spans over six decades. The aircraft was derived from the Cessna 170, a taildragger that first flew in 1948. The main difference was the introduction of tricycle landing gear, which improved the ground handling and visibility of the aircraft. The first Cessna 172 prototype flew on June 12, 1955, and was certified later that year. The first production model was delivered in 1956, and soon became a best-seller in the general aviation market. [1] [2]
 
The Cessna 172 Skyhawk has undergone many changes and improvements over the years, both in design and performance. Some of the notable variants include the Cessna 172A, which introduced a swept-back tailfin in 1960; the Cessna 172B, which increased the window size in 1961; the Cessna 172D, which lowered the rear deck and added an aft window in 1963; the Cessna 172F, which added electric flaps in 1965; the Cessna 172K, which introduced a drooped wing leading edge for better low-speed handling in 1970; the Cessna R172K Hawk XP, which featured a more powerful engine and a constant-speed propeller in 1977; and the Cessna 172RG Cutlass, which had retractable landing gear and a variable-pitch propeller in 1980.

The Cessna 172 Skyhawk also faced some challenges and setbacks in its history. In 1986, Cessna stopped producing piston-engine aircraft due to rising liability costs and declining sales. The production of the Cessna 172 Skyhawk resumed in 1996, after the passage of the General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994, which limited the liability of aircraft manufacturers. The new models were designated as Cessna 172R and Cessna 172S, and featured fuel-injected engines, redesigned interiors, improved avionics, and other enhancements. [2] [4]
 
The Cessna 172 Skyhawk is not only a popular aircraft for private owners and operators, but also for flight training schools and organizations. The aircraft is easy to fly, reliable, economical, and versatile. It can be used for various purposes such as recreation, transportation, aerial photography, surveying, patrol, and more. The aircraft is also widely used by the U.S. Civil Air Patrol (CAP), which is the official auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force. The CAP uses the Cessna 172 Skyhawk for missions such as search and rescue, disaster relief, homeland security, aerospace education, and cadet programs. [2] [5]
