It can also unroot your device if you want to restore it to its original state.
 
## What are the benefits of rooting your Android device?
 
Rooting your Android device means that you can access and modify the system files and settings that are normally hidden or restricted by the manufacturer or carrier. This gives you more freedom and customization options for your device. Some of the benefits of rooting your Android device are:
 
- You can install custom ROMs that offer different features and performance enhancements.
- You can remove bloatware and unwanted apps that take up space and resources.
- You can install root-only apps that can do things like backup and restore your data, block ads, tweak your CPU speed, and more.

## What are the risks of rooting your Android device?
 
Rooting your Android device also comes with some risks that you should be aware of before proceeding. Some of the risks of rooting your Android device are:

- You may void your warranty and lose official support from your manufacturer or carrier.
- You may brick your device if you do something wrong or use an incompatible tool or ROM.
- You may expose your device to security threats if you install malicious apps or grant root access to untrusted sources.
