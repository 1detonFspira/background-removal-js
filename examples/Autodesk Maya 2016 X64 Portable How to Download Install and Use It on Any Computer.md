Autodesk Maya 2016 X64 Portable is a modified version of Maya that can be run from a removable device without installation. It was created by a user named [MisterX](https://forum.cgpersia.com/f13/autodesk-maya-2016-x64-portable-130675/) on the CGPersia forum, who shared it for free with other users. The portable version of Maya is based on the official release of Autodesk Maya 2016 Service Pack 6, which is the latest update for the 2016 version of Maya.
 
The portable version of Maya has some advantages over the installed version. For example, you can use it on any computer that meets the minimum system requirements for Maya, regardless of the operating system or license. You can also easily switch between different versions of Maya by using different portable devices. Moreover, you can save your settings and preferences on the portable device, so you don't have to configure them every time you use Maya on a new computer.
 
However, there are also some drawbacks to using the portable version of Maya. For instance, you need to have a fast and reliable USB flash drive or external hard drive to run Maya smoothly. You also need to have enough free space on the device to store your projects and files. Furthermore, you may encounter some compatibility issues with some plugins or scripts that are not designed for the portable version of Maya. Additionally, you may not be able to access some online features or services that require authentication or registration with Autodesk.
