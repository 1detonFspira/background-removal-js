Mathworks Matlab R2016b is the latest release of the popular software for numerical computing, data analysis, and simulation. Matlab R2016b introduces new features that make working with big data easier and faster. It also includes enhancements to Simulink, a new product for risk management, and updates to 83 other products.
 
One of the main highlights of Matlab R2016b is the ability to work with data too big to fit in memory. Users can now access, process, and visualize data stored in files or databases using familiar Matlab syntax and functions. They can also use tall arrays to perform common operations such as filtering, sorting, aggregating, and plotting on out-of-memory data without having to write custom code or use specialized tools.

Another new feature of Matlab R2016b is the Live Editor, which allows users to create interactive documents that combine code, output, and formatted text. Users can edit code and see the results instantly, share their work with others, and generate reports or presentations from their live scripts.
 
Simulink, the graphical environment for model-based design and simulation, also gets new capabilities in R2016b. Users can now create reusable subsystems that can be parameterized by signals or dialog box inputs. They can also use the Simulation Manager to run multiple simulations in parallel or on clusters. Additionally, Simulink supports the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard for importing and exporting models across different tools.
 
R2016b also introduces a new product called Risk Management Toolbox, which provides functions and apps for assessing credit and market risk. Users can perform credit scoring, portfolio optimization, value-at-risk (VaR) analysis, and stress testing using historical or simulated data.
 
Other products that have been updated in R2016b include Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, Image Processing Toolbox, Optimization Toolbox, Signal Processing Toolbox, Computer Vision System Toolbox, and many more.
