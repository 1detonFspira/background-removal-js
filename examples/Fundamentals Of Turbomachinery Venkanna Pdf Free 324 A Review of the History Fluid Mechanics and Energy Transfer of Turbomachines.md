To do that, he uses a jetpack with a giant circular saw blade that can drill through walls and enemies. He also has access to various weapons and upgrades that he can buy from shops in Hell. He has to face 100 unique monsters, each with their own name and personality, and finish them off with hilarious mini-games that trigger brutal death animations.
 
The game features 10 huge game worlds with secret areas and side quests, colorful graphics and animations, a catchy soundtrack and a lot of jokes and references. The game is rated T for Teen by ESRB for its cartoon violence and crude humor.
 
If you are interested in playing Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit, you can download it from Steam, PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade or App Store. The game costs $14.99 for the main game and $19.49 for the collection that includes two DLC packs: Pimp My Rabbit Pack and Virtual Rabbit Missions.
  
Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit is not a game for everyone. It is a game that tries to be funny, crazy and over-the-top, but sometimes it goes too far and becomes annoying or boring. The game has a lot of potential, but it also has a lot of flaws that prevent it from being a great platformer.
 
One of the main problems of Hell Yeah! is the level design. The game has 10 different worlds, each with its own theme and style, but they are not very well designed or varied. The levels are often confusing and hard to navigate, with many dead ends and hidden paths that are not marked clearly. The game also relies too much on backtracking and revisiting previous areas to unlock new ones, which can be tedious and frustrating.

Another problem of Hell Yeah! is the combat. The game gives you a lot of weapons and upgrades to choose from, but they are not very satisfying or balanced. The weapons are either too weak or too powerful, and the upgrades are either too expensive or too useless. The enemies are also not very challenging or interesting, and they often respawn every time you enter a new area. The boss battles are more fun, but they are also repetitive and predictable.
 
The game tries to spice things up with the mini-games that you have to play to finish off the bosses, but they are also hit or miss. Some of them are funny and creative, but others are boring and frustrating. The mini-games are also not very well explained, so you often have to guess what to do or die trying. The game also has some technical issues, such as sound glitches, frame drops and long loading times.
 
Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit is not a bad game, but it is not a great one either. It is a game that has a lot of personality and humor, but it also has a lot of problems and limitations. It is a game that can be fun and entertaining for a while, but it can also be annoying and boring after some time. It is a game that you might want to try if you like crazy platformers, but you might also want to avoid if you prefer more polished and refined ones.
