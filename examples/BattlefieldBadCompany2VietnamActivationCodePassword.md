1. Know your Battlefield: Bad Company 2 CD-Codes. First of all you need your Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and your Battlefield: Bad Company Vietnam key (if you own the DLC). You can find them at your Steam library. Battlefield Bad Company 2 (right click) -> Manage -> View Product Keys. Copy them[^1^].
2. Redeem your Vietnam key on Origin/EA website. If you bought Vietnam DLC, you need to redeem its key on Origin/EA website. Go to https://www.origin.com/ and log in with your EA account (or create one if you don't have it). Then go to My Game Library -> Add a Game -> Redeem Product Code. Enter your Vietnam key and click Next[^1^] [^2^].
3. Login with your Origin account in the game. Start Battlefield Bad Company 2 and in the main menu, click on Vietnam. Login with your Origin account to unlock the DLC. If you are getting asked for a key then the game and the DLC are on different accounts. You might need to contact EA support to merge them[^2^].
4. Enjoy the game! Once you have activated the DLC, you can play it by selecting Vietnam from the main menu. Remember, there are a few servers in Vietnam DLC servers menu and mostly empty, and don't go there. Just go to BFBC2 servers menu and look for Vietnam servers there[^1^].
