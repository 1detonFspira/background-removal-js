Real-time systems are systems that have to meet strict deadlines for their tasks, such as controlling a car, a robot, or a nuclear reactor. These systems require careful design and analysis to ensure their correctness and reliability. In this article, we will introduce the book *Real-time Systems* by C. M. Krishna and Kang G. Shin, which is a classic textbook on the subject.
 
The book covers all the major topics of real-time systems, such as:

- Task allocation and scheduling
- Synchronization and communication
- Fault-tolerance and reliability
- Performance measures and evaluation
- Real-time architectures and algorithms

The book also includes exercises, examples, case studies, and references for further reading. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as researchers and practitioners in the field of real-time systems.

Real-time systems have many applications in various domains, such as robotics, aerospace, automotive, industrial automation, multimedia, and healthcare. These applications require different levels of real-time guarantees, depending on the consequences of missing a deadline. For example, a robotic arm that performs a surgery needs to have a hard real-time system, which means that any delay or failure can result in a catastrophic outcome. On the other hand, a video streaming service can have a soft real-time system, which means that some delay or degradation can be tolerated without affecting the overall functionality.
 
Some examples of real-time systems are:

- Air traffic control systems: These systems monitor and coordinate the movements of aircrafts in the airspace, and provide guidance and instructions to pilots and ground staff. They have to process a large amount of data from various sources, such as radar, GPS, weather reports, and flight plans, and ensure that no collisions or accidents occur. They have to meet strict deadlines and provide high reliability and availability.
- Autonomous vehicles: These systems enable vehicles to drive themselves without human intervention, using sensors, cameras, maps, and artificial intelligence. They have to perceive the environment, plan the route, control the speed and steering, and communicate with other vehicles and infrastructure. They have to react quickly and safely to dynamic and uncertain situations, such as traffic lights, pedestrians, obstacles, and road conditions.
- Industrial robots: These systems perform various tasks in manufacturing and assembly processes, such as welding, painting, cutting, and packaging. They have to coordinate with other robots and machines, follow precise instructions, and adapt to changes in the environment. They have to ensure high quality and efficiency of the products and avoid any errors or damages.

These are just some of the examples of real-time systems that are widely used in today's world. As technology advances, more applications will emerge that require real-time capabilities. Therefore, it is important to understand the principles and techniques of designing and implementing real-time systems.
