## How to Use OrCAD PSpice for Windows 8 64 Bit
 
After installing OrCAD PSpice, you can start using it to design and simulate your electronic circuits. Here are some basic steps to get you started:

1. Launch OrCAD Capture CIS from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut.
2. Create a new project by selecting "File > New > Project". Choose a name and location for your project, and select "Analog or Mixed A/D" as the project type.
3. Add a schematic page by selecting "File > New > Schematic". You can also add multiple pages to your project if needed.
4. Draw your circuit using the tools and commands on the toolbar and the menu bar. You can also use the "Place Part" button to access the component library and search for the parts you need.
5. To assign values and parameters to your components, double-click on them and edit their properties in the dialog box that appears.
6. To connect your components with wires, use the "Place Wire" button or press "W" on your keyboard. You can also use buses, ports, off-page connectors, and other symbols to organize your circuit.
7. To add voltage and current sources, probes, ground symbols, and other elements for simulation, use the "PSpice > Place" menu or press "P" on your keyboard.
8. To set up your simulation profile, select "PSpice > New Simulation Profile". Choose a name and type for your simulation, such as DC sweep, AC sweep, transient analysis, etc. You can also adjust the simulation settings and options in the dialog box that appears.
9. To run your simulation, select "PSpice > Run" or press "F11" on your keyboard. You can also use the "PSpice > Advanced Analysis" menu to perform more complex simulations such as sensitivity analysis, optimization analysis, Monte Carlo analysis, etc.
10. To view your simulation results, select "PSpice > View Output File" or press "F12" on your keyboard. You can also use the "PSpice > Probe" menu to open the Probe window, where you can plot various waveforms and graphs of your circuit variables.
