- Choose your hamster wisely. There are six hamsters to choose from, each with different attributes and abilities. Some are faster, some are more agile, some are more balanced. Pick the one that suits your playstyle and the level you are facing.
- Use the tilt controls. The game allows you to control your hamster ball by tilting the Wii Remote or the PS2 controller. This gives you more precision and responsiveness than using the analog stick or the D-pad. However, you need to be careful not to tilt too much or too little, as you may lose balance or momentum.
- Collect the stars and coins. Each level has a number of stars and coins scattered around. Stars give you extra points and coins give you extra lives. Try to collect as many as you can, but don't risk falling off the edge or running out of time. You can also use coins to unlock new hamsters and levels in the shop.
- Watch out for enemies and hazards. Hamster X has placed many obstacles and traps in your way, such as spikes, lasers, cannons, magnets, fans and more. Some of them can damage your hamster ball or push you off the track. Others can help you if you use them wisely, such as springs, ramps and switches. Be alert and avoid or exploit them as needed.
- Practice and have fun. The game has 15 levels of increasing difficulty, plus a bonus level if you collect all the stars. Some of them may require multiple attempts and strategies to complete. Don't give up and keep trying until you succeed. You can also play with your friends in the multiplayer mode, where you can race or battle against each other.

Hamster Heroes is a game that can provide hours of entertainment and challenge for players of all ages. If you follow these tips and tricks, you will be able to enjoy the game even more and become a hamster hero yourself.
