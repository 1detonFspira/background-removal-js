## The Production History
 
The musical was first developed in 2005 by Dolly Parton and Patricia Resnick, who wanted to update the film's story and message for a modern audience. They worked with director Joe Mantello and choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler to create a workshop production that was presented in Los Angeles in 2007. The workshop received positive feedback from critics and audiences, and led to a pre-Broadway tryout in Los Angeles in 2008. The tryout featured Allison Janney as Violet, Megan Hilty as Doralee, Stephanie J. Block as Judy, and Marc Kudisch as Hart. The tryout was also well-received and made some minor changes before moving to Broadway in 2009.
 
The Broadway production opened at the Marquis Theatre on April 30, 2009, with the same cast as the tryout. The production received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances of the leads and the music of Parton, but criticized the book and direction for being too faithful to the film and lacking originality. The production was nominated for four Tony Awards, including Best Original Score for Parton. The production closed on September 6, 2009, after 148 performances.
 
The musical then embarked on a US national tour in 2010-2011, with Dee Hoty as Violet, Diana DeGarmo as Doralee, Mamie Parris as Judy, and Joseph Mahowald as Hart. The tour visited 26 cities across the country and received positive reviews from local critics and audiences. The tour also made some changes to the script and score to make them more suitable for touring venues.
 
The musical made its West End debut at the Savoy Theatre on January 28, 2019, with Louise Redknapp as Violet (later replaced by Caroline Sheen), Amber Davies as Judy, Natalie McQueen as Doralee, and Brian Conley as Hart. The production was directed by Jeff Calhoun and choreographed by Lisa Stevens. The production received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised the cast's energy and charisma, as well as Parton's involvement in promoting the show. The production was nominated for four Laurence Olivier Awards
