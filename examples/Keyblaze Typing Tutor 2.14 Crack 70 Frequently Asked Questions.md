You can also play Word Wipeout, which is a game where you have to type words that appear on a grid before they disappear.
 
To measure your typing skills objectively, you can also take some typing tests that give you a score based on your WPM and accuracy. You can choose from different test types such as timed tests, custom tests, or advanced tests that include complex texts such as prose or poetry.
