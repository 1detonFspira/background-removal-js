# How to Download Super Sidekicks 3: The Next Glory for PC
 
If you are a fan of soccer games, you might have heard of Super Sidekicks 3: The Next Glory, a classic arcade game from 1995 developed and published by SNK. This game is the third installment in the Super Sidekicks series, and it features an arcade-style approach to soccer with 64 teams to choose from and various modes to play. Super Sidekicks 3: The Next Glory was originally released for the Neo Geo arcade system, but it was also ported to the Neo Geo CD and the Neo Geo AES home console.
 
But what if you want to play this game on your PC? Well, there are two ways to do that: either by using an emulator or by downloading a ROM file. An emulator is a software that mimics the hardware and software of another system, allowing you to run games and applications that were not designed for your PC. A ROM file is a copy of the data stored on a game cartridge or disc, which can be loaded by an emulator. In this article, we will show you how to download Super Sidekicks 3: The Next Glory for PC using both methods.

We suggest using Old Games Download, which offers a safe and legal download of the game: [https://oldgamesdownload.com/super-sidekicks-3-the-next-glory/](https://oldgamesdownload.com/super-sidekicks-3-the-next-glory/). Choose the Arcade version of the game and click on the download link. Save the zip file to the same folder where you extracted MAME.
