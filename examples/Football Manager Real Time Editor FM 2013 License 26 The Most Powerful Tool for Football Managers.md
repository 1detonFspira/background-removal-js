FM Editor Live 2013 is a handy tool for those who want to tweak some aspects of their Football Manager 2013 game without using complex editors or cheats. It is easy to use and works very fast. However, it is not a full-fledged editor and does not allow you to edit everything in the game. For example, you cannot edit player attributes, staff attributes, club facilities, league rules, etc. If you want more control over your game, you might want to try other editors such as FMRTE or Genie Scout.
  
## What is FMRTE and How to Use It?
 
If you want more control and customization over your Football Manager 2013 game, you might want to try FMRTE. FMRTE stands for Football Manager Real Time Editor and it is a powerful tool that allows you to edit almost everything in the game. You can edit player attributes, staff attributes, club facilities, league rules, transfers, contracts, injuries, bans, loans, etc. You can also use FMRTE as a scouting tool to find players and staff that match your criteria.
 
To use FMRTE, you need to have .NET Framework 4.5 or higher installed on your computer. You also need to have your game updated with the 13.3.3 patch. You can download FMRTE from [here](https://www.fmrte.com/). After downloading, install FMRTE on your computer and run it. Make sure you have your Football Manager 2013 game running and loaded with your save game (or start a new one).
 
Once you run FMRTE, you will see a dashboard with several tabs and buttons. You can use the search box on the top left corner to find any club or person in the game. You can also use the advanced search feature to filter your results by various criteria. You can access the advanced search by clicking on the magnifying glass icon next to the search box.
 
When you find the club or person you want to edit, double-click on their name and a new window will pop up with all the editable fields. You can change any value by typing a new one or using the arrows or sliders. You can also use presets to apply predefined changes to multiple fields at once. You can access presets by clicking on the star icon on the top right corner of the window.
 
After making your changes, click the "Save" button to apply them to your game. You can also click the "Freeze" button to prevent any changes in the future.
